RUN FOR YOU LIFE.
Is that the best you can do?
Come on, a baby could beat that.
You had one job.
I beat that with my eyes closed.
There's only one way to go now.
Right is always right
For the love of god

Maybe that was too hard for you?
It's not that hard.
Come on, that one's easy.
You weren't meant to die there.
That level was only for filler.

Death is innevitable.
Delay the innevitable.
